    "    - The players must use the cards which have the same color and consecutive number to the cards on the board.\n",
    "        - For example, if there is ♠7 on board, the next player must use ♠6, ♠8 or ♥7,♦7,♣7.\n",
    "    - If a player has not card can be used, he/she needs to suppress one card. This card should not be seen by the other players until the end of this game.\n",
